# socket_python
Web Server Lab - Python Socket Programming
This project involves developing a simple web server and client in Python that handles HTTP requests and serves files over a TCP connection. The web server listens for incoming connections, parses HTTP GET requests, retrieves requested files from the serverâ€™s file system, and sends HTTP responses. If the requested file is not found, the server returns a "404 Not Found" error.

The client connects to the server via a TCP connection, sends an HTTP GET request for a specified file, and displays the server's response, including handling both valid file requests and error responses like "404 Not Found".

This project also provides insights into socket programming, HTTP request/response formatting, and network traffic analysis using Wireshark.

Key Features:
Server: Listens on a specified port, processes HTTP requests, and serves requested files with proper headers.
Client: Sends HTTP GET requests to the server, displays responses, and handles error cases.
Error Handling: Handles "404 Not Found" errors when a file is not available on the server.
Wireshark Analysis: Captures network traffic to monitor the communication between the client and server.
Usage:
Server: Run the server script and place an HTML file in the server's directory.
Client: Use command-line arguments to specify the server host, port, and filename.
